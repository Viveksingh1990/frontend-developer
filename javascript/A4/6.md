## Exercise 1

### 1.1  
Create a function called `checkDrivingEligibility` that takes one argument called `age`. Inside the function, use an `if` statement to check if the `age` is greater than or equal to 16. If it is, log a message indicating that the person is eligible for driving.

**Example**  
Call the function with the argument `18`.  
**Expected output:**  
"You are eligible for driving."

### 1.2  
Create a function called `compareStrings` that takes two arguments called `str1` and `str2`. Inside the function, use an `if/else` statement to compare the lengths of `str1` and `str2`. If the length of `str1` is greater than `str2`, log a message indicating that `str1` is longer. Otherwise, log a message indicating that `str2` is longer.

**Example**  
Call the function with two arguments `"Hello"` and `"World"`.  
**Expected output:**  
"Both strings are of the same length."

### 1.3  
Create a function called `calculateDiscount` that takes two arguments: `purchaseAmount` and `isMember`. Inside the function, use `if/else` statements to apply a discount based on the following conditions:

- If `isMember` is true, apply a 15% discount.
- If `purchaseAmount` is greater than 100, apply a 10% discount.
- If neither condition is met, return the `purchaseAmount` without any discount.

**Example**  
Call the function with `purchaseAmount` as `120` and `isMember` as `true`.  
**Expected output:**  
"Total after discount: 102"

---

### 1.4  
Create a function called `findSmallestNumber` that takes three arguments: `num1`, `num2`, and `num3`. Inside the function, use an `if/else` statement to compare the values and return the smallest number among the three.

**Example**  
Call the function with `num1 = 7`, `num2 = 3`, and `num3 = 5`.  
**Expected output:**  
"3"

---

### 1.5  
Create a function called `calculateTax` that takes two arguments: `income` and `isTaxable`. Inside the function, calculate the tax based on the following conditions:

- If `isTaxable` is true, calculate a tax of 20% on the `income`.
- If `income` is less than 5000, do not apply any tax.
- Otherwise, apply a tax of 15%.

Return the final tax amount.

**Example**  
Call the function with `income = 8000` and `isTaxable = true`.  
**Expected output:**  
"Tax amount: 1600"
