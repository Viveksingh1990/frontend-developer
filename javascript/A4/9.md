# Exercise 1: Basic Conditional and Looping Functions

## 1.1

Write a function `isPositive` that takes a number as an argument and checks if it is greater than zero. If it is, `console.log` "The number is positive." Otherwise, `console.log` "The number is not positive."

Call the function with the argument -5 to check the output.

**Expected output:**

The number is not positive.
## 1.2

Write a function `compareStrings` that takes two string arguments and compares them. If the strings are equal, log "The strings are identical." If they are not equal, log "The strings are different."

Call the function with two strings: "apple" and "banana".

**Expected output:**

The strings are different.
## 1.3

Create a function `calculateTax` that accepts a salary and a tax rate. The function should return the amount of tax to be paid based on the salary and tax rate. If the salary is above 100,000, apply a 30% tax rate; if it's 50,000 or above, apply a 20% tax rate; otherwise, apply a 10% tax rate.

Call the function with a salary of 120000 and see the output.

**Expected output:**

The tax to be paid is: 36000
# Exercise 2: Basic Array and Object Manipulation

## 2.1

Write a function `findLargest` that accepts an array of numbers and returns the largest number from the array.

Call the function with the array `[5, 2, 9, 1, 3]` and log the result.

**Expected output:**

9
## 2.2

Write a function `addItemToCart` that takes an object representing a shopping cart (with items as key-value pairs) and adds a new item to the cart. The function should return the updated cart object.

Call the function with an initial cart object `{ apple: 2, orange: 3 }` and add a new item: "banana": 5.

**Expected output:**
## 2.3 
Create a function sumNumbers that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of all the numbers in the array.Call the function with the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].Expected output:15
# Exercise 3: String and Number Manipulation

## 3.1 
Write a function reverseString that takes a string and returns the string reversed.Call the function with the string "hello".Expected output:"olleh"
## 3.2 
Write a function isPalindrome that checks if a string is a palindrome (a word that reads the same backward as forward). The function should return true if the string is a palindrome and false otherwise.Call the function with the string "madam".Expected output:true
## 3.3 
Create a function countWords that takes a sentence and returns the number of words in the sentence. Assume words are separated by spaces.Call the function with the sentence "I love programming in JavaScript".Expected output:5
Exercise 4: Handling Dates and Times4.1Write a function getDayOfWeek that takes a date string in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" and returns the day of the week (e.g., "Monday", "Tuesday").Call the function with the date "2025-05-05".Expected output:Monday
## 4.2
Write a function daysBetweenDates that takes two date strings in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" and returns the number of days between the two dates.Call the function with the dates "2025-05-01" and "2025-05-05".Expected output:4
##  4.3
Create a function formatTime that takes a number of seconds and returns it formatted as "HH:MM:SS" (e.g., 3661 seconds becomes "01:01:01").Call the function with 3661.
Expected output:01:01:01
# Exercise 5: Advanced Loops and Array Manipulation
## 5.1 
Write a function filterEvenNumbers that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array that only contains the even numbers from the original array.Call the function with the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
Expected output:[2, 4, 6]

## 5.2 
Create a function mapNamesToUpperCase that takes an array of names and returns a new array where all the names are in uppercase.Call the function with the array ["alice", "bob", "charlie"].
Expected output:["ALICE", "BOB", "CHARLIE"]

## 5.3 
Write a function findFirstPositiveNumber that takes an array of numbers and returns the first positive number found in the array. If there are no positive numbers, return null.Call the function with the array [-5, -2, -3, 4, 1].
Expected output:4
