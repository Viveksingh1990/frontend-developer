# Question:
Write a JavaScript program that performs the following exercises using string concatenation, variable assignments, and console outputs. Each exercise should have its own console section, as shown below.

## Exercise 1: Working with Days, Employees, and Ages

## 1. Week Days:
- Declare three variables `weekday1`, `weekday2`, and `weekday3` and assign them the values `"Thursday"`, `"Friday"`, and `"Saturday"`.
- Concatenate these variables into a single variable `weekdaysList`, separating each day with a space. Print `weekdaysList` to display all three days in one line.

## 2. Employee Greetings:
- Define three variables `staff1`, `staff2`, and `staff3` and assign them names: `"Sarah"`, `"David"`, and `"Lucas"`.
- Create individual greeting messages for each employee by concatenating `"Hello, "` with each name. Store each greeting in `greeting1`, `greeting2`, and `greeting3`, then print each greeting.

## 3. Displaying Ages:
- Declare three numeric variables `ageA`, `ageB`, and `ageC` with values `22`, `30`, and `40`, representing ages.
- Print each age in a separate console output, following the format: `"This person is "` and the respective age variable (`ageA`, `ageB`, or `ageC`).
