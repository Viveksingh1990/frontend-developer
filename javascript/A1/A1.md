# Exercise 1

## 1. Declare and Initialize Variables

Create a variable `myName` and assign it your name as a string. Print it to the console.

## 2. Single Character String

Declare a variable `singleChar` with a single character (e.g., `"A"`) and print it.

## 3. String with Special Characters

Create a variable `line` that contains a sentence, such as `"I'm enjoying my programming journey"`. Print this sentence to the console.

## 4. Variable Assignment

Declare a variable `varOne` with a string value, then create another variable `varTwo` that copies the value of `varOne`. Print `varTwo` to the console.

## 5. String Concatenation

Declare two variables, `partOne` and `partTwo`, with string values. Concatenate them into a new variable `full` and print the result.
 
# Exercise 2: Working with Different Data Types

## 1. Number Type

Declare a variable `num` with a numeric value (e.g., `10`) and print it to the console.

## 2. Boolean Type

Declare two boolean variables, `isTrue` and `isFalse`, with values `true` and `false`, respectively. Print each to the console.

## 3. Comments

Add multiple lines of comments in your code using `//` that explain any code segment.  
Make sure to have at least **three commented-out lines**, and then print the message `"Wooh! Just learned comments"` to the console.

This exercise covers the steps and concepts present in the code, including:

- Working with strings, numbers, and booleans  
- Variable assignment  
- Concatenation  
- Writing comments

It allows learners to get familiar with basic data handling and code organization in JavaScript.
