## 1.2 Calculate the difference between `numberOne` and `numberTwo` and log the individual numbers and the result to the console.

## 1.3 Calculate the product of `numberOne` and `numberTwo` and log the individual numbers and the result to the console.

## 1.4 Calculate the division of `numberOne` by `numberTwo` and log the individual numbers and the result to the console.

## 1.5 Calculate the remainder of `numberOne` divided by `numberTwo` and log the individual numbers and the result to the console.

# Exercise 2

## 2.1 Declare a third variable, `numberThree`, and assign it a value of your choice. Calculate the sum of `numberOne`, `numberTwo`, and `numberThree`. Log the individual numbers and the result to the console.

## 2.2 Subtract the sum of `numberOne` and `numberTwo` from `numberThree` and log the individual numbers and the result to the console.

## 2.3 Calculate the product of `numberOne` and `numberTwo`, then add `numberThree` to the result. Log the individual numbers and the result to the console.

## 2.4 Divide `numberThree` by `numberOne` and then add `numberTwo` to the result. Log the individual numbers and the result to the console.

## 2.5 Calculate the average of `numberOne`, `numberTwo`, and `numberThree`. Log the individual numbers and the result to the console.
