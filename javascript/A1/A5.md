# Exercise 1: Working with String Variables and Assignments

## 1. City Name Variable
- Declare a variable `cityName`, assign it the name of a city (e.g., `"New York"`), and print it to the console.

## 2. Single Character Assignment
- Create a variable `singleChar` containing a single character (e.g., `"A"`) and print it.

## 3. Sentence Variable
- Define a variable `sentence` with a sentence like `"Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out"` and print it.

## 4. Variable Copying
- Declare a variable `originalVariable` with a string value.  
- Copy that value into another variable, `duplicateVariable`, and print `duplicateVariable`.

## 5. String Concatenation
- Create two string variables, `firstPart` and `secondPart`.  
- Concatenate them into a new variable `combinedString` and print the result.

# Exercise 2: Working with Numbers, Booleans, and Comments

## 1. Numeric Variable
- Declare a variable `totalDays` with a numeric value (e.g., `30`) and print it.

## 2. Boolean Variables

  - `isActive` with value `false`
  - `isAdmin` with value `true`
- Print each one.

## 3. Commenting in Code
- Add comments in your code using `//`.
- Write at least three commented lines.
- Include a `console.log` statement that says `"This is how we add comments"`.
