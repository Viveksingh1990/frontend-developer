# Exercise 2: Arithmetic Operations and Calculations

## 2.1
Write a function `subtractFromBalance` that takes a `balance` parameter and a `subtractionAmount`, then returns the new balance after subtracting the `subtractionAmount` (e.g., `balance - subtractionAmount`). Call the function with sample values and log the result.

## 2.2
Write a function `divideNumbers` that takes two numbers as parameters and returns the quotient when the first number is divided by the second. Call the function with two sample numbers and log the result.

## 2.3
Write a function `calculateTotalCost` that takes three prices (`price1`, `price2`, `price3`) and their respective quantities (`quantity1`, `quantity2`, `quantity3`). It should return the total cost by calculating the sum of all products (e.g., `(price1 * quantity1) + (price2 * quantity2) + (price3 * quantity3)`). Call this function with sample values and log the result.

## 2.4
Write a function `finalPriceAfterTax` that takes an original price and a `taxRate` and calculates the final price after applying the tax (e.g., `price + (price * taxRate / 100)`). Call this function with a sample price and tax rate, then log the result.

# Exercise 3: Handling and Combining Data

## 3.1
Write a function `createIntro` that takes a `firstName` and `lastName` as parameters and returns a full name in the format: "Full Name: [firstName] [lastName]". Call the function with sample names and log the result.

## 3.2
Write a function `combineStrings` that accepts three string parameters and returns them combined into a single sentence (e.g., "string1 string2 string3"). Call the function with three words and log the result.

## 3.3
Write a function `pairColors` that takes five color names as parameters and returns a string showing the colors paired in groups of two (e.g., "Color Pairs: Red-Green, Blue-Yellow"). Call the function with five colors and log the result.

## 3.4
Write a function `calculateDiscountedPrice` that takes an `originalPrice` and a `discountPercent` and returns the price after applying the discount (e.g., `originalPrice - (originalPrice * discountPercent / 100)`). Call this function with a sample price and discount percentage, then log the result.
