### Product Data Initialization

Define variables for three products, including their names, categories, prices, stock quantities, and discount percentages. Use descriptive variable names for each product, such as:
- `product1Name`, `product1Category`, `product1Price`, `product1StockQuantity`, `product1DiscountPercentage`.
- Repeat for `product2` and `product3`.

### Discount Calculation

For each product, write if-else statements to calculate the final price after discount based on the following conditions:
- If the stock quantity is greater than 50 and the discount percentage is greater than 20%, the discount price should be 30% off the original price.
- If the stock quantity is greater than 30 and the discount percentage is greater than 10%, the discount price should be 20% off the original price.
- Otherwise, the discount price should be 10% off the original price.

Store the calculated final price for each product in corresponding variables (`product1FinalPrice`, `product2FinalPrice`, `product3FinalPrice`).
