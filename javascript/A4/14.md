# JavaScript Exercises: Payroll and Compensation Logic

## Exercise 1: Determine Base Salary
1.1 Create a variable `dailyWage` set to 800 and another variable `workingDays` set to 22.  
1.2 Write a function `computeBaseSalary` that multiplies `dailyWage` by `workingDays`. Print the result.

## Exercise 2: Handle Weekend Work Compensation
2.1 Create a variable `weekendRateMultiplier` set to 2.  
2.2 Write a function `computeWeekendPay` that calculates extra pay for 4 weekend days worked. Multiply the daily wage by the multiplier and the number of weekend days. Display the result.

## Exercise 3: Compute Benefits Deductions
3.1 Define `healthInsuranceRate` as 0.08, `socialSecurityRate` as 0.06, and `pensionRate` as 0.04.  
3.2 Create a function `getTotalDeductions` that computes the total amount deducted from base salary using the above rates. Return and log the deduction amount.

## Exercise 4: Final Earnings Calculation
4.1 Write a function `calculateTotalEarnings` that adds base salary and weekend pay, then subtracts total deductions. Print the final amount earned.

## Exercise 5: Performance-Based Rewards
5.1 Set a variable `employeeRating` to 9.  
5.2 Write a function `assignReward` that returns a reward based on the following criteria:
- 9 or 10 → ₹15,000
- 7 or 8 → ₹10,000
- 5 or 6 → ₹5,000
- Below 5 → ₹0  
Call the function and print the reward.

## Exercise 6: Build Employee Salary Report
6.1 Write a function `createSalaryReport` that takes `employeeName`, `baseSalary`, `weekendPay`, `deductions`, `reward`, and final earnings.  
6.2 Log a structured salary report for an employee named "Anjali" using the function and previously calculated values.
