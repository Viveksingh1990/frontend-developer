### Exercise 2

#### 2.1 Calculate Price with Tax

You have the base price of a product and a tax percentage. Your task is to calculate the tax amount and the final price after including the tax.

- Declare a variable named `basePrice` and assign it the value `1200`.
- Declare a variable named `taxPercentage` and assign it the value `18`.
- Calculate the tax amount by multiplying the `basePrice` with the `taxPercentage` and dividing the result by `100`. Store the result in a variable named `taxAmount`.
- Calculate the final price by adding the `taxAmount` to the `basePrice`. Store the result in a variable named `finalPrice`.
- Print the value of `basePrice` to the console using the following format:  
  `"Base Price: 1200"`
- Print the value of `taxPercentage` to the console using the following format:  
  `"Tax Percentage: 18%"`
- Print the value of `taxAmount` to the console using the following format:  
  `"Tax Amount: 216"`
- Print the value of `finalPrice` to the console using the following format:  
  `"Final Price (including tax): 1416"`

#### 2.2 Calculate Total Invoice with Multiple Products

You are generating an invoice for a list of items. Each item has a price and quantity. Your task is to compute individual totals and the final invoice total.

- Declare variables for the items: `itemA`, `itemB`, and `itemC`, and assign them the values: `"Notebook"`, `"Pen"`, and `"Bag"`.
- Declare variables for the prices of the items: `itemAPrice`, `itemBPrice`, and `itemCPrice`, and assign them the values: `80`, `20`, and `700`.
- Declare variables for the quantities: `itemAQuantity`, `itemBQuantity`, and `itemCQuantity`, and assign them the values: `3`, `5`, and `1`.
- Calculate the total price for each item and store them in: `totalItemAPrice`, `totalItemBPrice`, and `totalItemCPrice`.
- Add up all total item prices to get the `totalInvoiceAmount`.
- Print item names.
- Print a separator line using dashes.
- Print the total price of each item in the format:  
  `"Price of Notebook x 3: 240"`  
  `"Price of Pen x 5: 100"`  
  `"Price of Bag x 1: 700"`
- Print another separator line using dashes.
- Print the final invoice total in the format:  
  `"Total Invoice Amount: 1040"`
