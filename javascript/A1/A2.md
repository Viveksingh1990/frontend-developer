## Exercise 1: Working with Strings

## 1. Declare and Initialize Variables:

Create a variable `cityName` and assign it the name of your favorite city as a string. Print it to the console.

## 2. Single Character String:

Declare a variable `grade` with a single character value (e.g., `"B"`) and print it.

## 3. String with Special Characters:

Create a variable `quote` that contains the sentence: `"She said, "Practice makes perfect!"` Use escape characters properly and print it to the console.

## 4. Variable Assignment:

Declare a variable `original` with a string value, then assign that value to another variable `copy`. Print `copy` to the console.

## 5. String Concatenation:

Declare two variables, `firstName` and `lastName`, and assign them your first and last name as strings. Concatenate them into a new variable `fullName` and print the result.

Declare a variable `age` with a numeric value (e.g., `25`) and print it to the console.

## 2. Boolean Type:

Declare two boolean variables, `isStudent` and `hasGraduated`, with values `true` and `false`, respectively, and print each to the console.

## 3. Comments:
